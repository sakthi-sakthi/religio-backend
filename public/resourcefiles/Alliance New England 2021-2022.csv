Year two of a pandemic. We as a church community started the year fully online and ended the year in a new space, meeting in person. Over the course of this year we changed locations, began to meet in person and the Lord delivered us a new meeting space that meets all our needs. As the pastor of this community, it may have added some grey hair, but the hand of the Lord was evident. We feel some great momentum as we are exiting this pandemic (hopefully) and are excited about where the Lord has placed us. It was a wild ride but we learned a lot. We can now easily pivot to a digital only service, we REALLY appreciate being back together and we are thankful that everyone recovered from bouts with Covid. The Lord is good and we are looking forward to see where He leads in 2022.     Pastor Louis ",,,,
